            <pre> <b> About us </b><br>
    Weâ€™re the largest network of grassroots, environmental and human rights groups in central and eastern Europe.
    <br>
    We monitor public finance institutions that are responsible for hundreds of billions of investments across the globe. 
    The banks and funds we watch are often obscure but always important entities that function outside public scrutiny.
    <br>
    Together with local communities and other NGOs we work to expose their influence and provide a counterbalance to their unchecked power.
